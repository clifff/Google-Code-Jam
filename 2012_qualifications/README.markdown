# Google Code Jam 2012 Qualifications

My solutions to three of the problems in the 2012 GCJ qualificaton
round. 20 out of a possible 100 points were needed to qualify, and I got 45 points. Solutions for 'speaking_in_tounges' and
'dancing_with_googlers' passed both large and small inputs, and
'recycled_numbers' only the small input.
